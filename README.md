# CustomBigInteger
 
Allows Serialization for System.Numerics.BigInteger

Allows you to save data into a string and BigInteger will parse that string's data, so you can save and load serializable BigInteger data

Mainly wrote for UnityEngine but can be used for other projects

Example: Test/TestCustomBigInteger.cs

No special setup. Just add the file and call "CustomBigInteger" as a variable, etc.
